### 1. What is git vs GitHub? 
Git is the mechanism behind GitHub.
Git is version control software. GitHub is just a way to easily share the information. 

### 2. Why would you want to use git, and can you use it without GitHub? 
I think GitHub is a home for your files. 

### 3. What does commit mean? 

### 4. What does it mean to push and pull changes? 
Push = permanent change to most updated version.
Have to push to get it up to the remote repository. Just committing does it for your local repository. 
Pull = other party will pull new changes. 

### 5. Why are commit and push separate events? 
Commit allows you to have waypoints to go back to. You can't pull the same file you're working on without committing your changes. 

### 6. Where are the files in your repository stored? 
The files are at least on my laptop and GitHub + others..... 

Thanks for eaching these two **old dogs** new tricks!
